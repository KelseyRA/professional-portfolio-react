# React Professional Portfolio

## Project Description

In this project I updated my previous portfolio using React. The goal is to create a portfolio that is a single page application which servers the view specific information once the links are clicked. The user will move around the different sections of the application with out the page reloading. They will be able to review a brief bio, contact information, portfolio projects, my resume, and proficiencies. They will also be able to access the header and footer no matter what section they are on. Additionally they are able to download my resume and visit all my project repos and deployed links.
